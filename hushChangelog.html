<title>Hush::Changelog</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Planned to do (in no particular order): 
<ul>
	<li>Complete change of Found Content Window system to use listview object (could be a while off, see how the current system goes)</li>
	<li>DCC stat tracking to analyze which bots give you the fastest transfers</li>
	<li>Click and drag to highlight text in KVIrc then select "Add to Hush Searches" from context menu - don't know how to achieve this</li>
	<li>Library Related</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Automated extraction of files from TAR/RAR archives on download completion</li>
		<li>Add auto extract/move support for Linux systems</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Instant Search Related</li>
	<ul> 
		<li>Idea: options for when you dont know what to look for, kind of like Google "I'm feeling lucky". Or something to show "hot packs"</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Search Acquisition</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Check if search title eists in movie library array already to prevent duplicate downloads</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Transfer Management</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Add a timer that periodically checks the current and/or average speed of active downloads and decides whether or not to terminate them</li>
		<li>Create option for Hush to ignore DCC file transfers. This will make it possible to request packs from multiple systems [slaves], but have them sent to one particular system [master]. Slaves will ignore DCC file transfers and the master will recieve them all.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>UI</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Create a widget somewhere for active transfers to see % complete and file category in drop down box</li>
		<li>Complete UI redo</li>
		<li>Revisit all the ZNC and FCW messages and possibly construct an option that lets you select which messages you want to see.
	</ul>
</ul>
Known Issues: 
<ul>
	<li>Seems to start more transfers than the maximum limit - Many of the conditions that cause this to happen have been addressed but there are so many possibilities that can lead to either too many downloads or the download system stopping incorrectly that the fixes for this are an ongoing bug hunt.</li>
	<li>If you upgrade Hush, it always seems to throw a red error of some variety saying "The left side of the scope operator evaluated to a null object reference"
	Pretty sure this is because the main Hush object gets destroyed and the upgrade procedure doesn't create a new Hush object. If you get this happening, just 
	press Ctrl+Alt+H and it should be fine.</li>
	<li>KVIrc will "freeze" or got to "Not Responding", mouse inputs are halted etc. when Hush triggers its passive search. This is most noticable if you have a lot of passive searches and I can't find any way to prevent this. You can increase the time between passive searches in Options to reduce how often it occurs.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>v0.4.0 - 20191022</h2>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>Bugfix - Fixed bug in Aliases::moveToLibrary that was matching TV Show names incorrectly.</li>
	<li>Bugfix - Changed %optionsWidget to %options in hush::showOptions.</li>
	<li>Functions - Alter hush::searchDownloadHashForStatus to accept a hash as second argument, otherwise attempt to default to hushDownloadHash. improved function flow and debug output.</li>
	<li>Options - Added options to make Hush quiet (no messages output to user). The aim is to offer a silent experience, with Hush running like a server in the background fetching media for you.</li>
	<li>Options - Added Transfer Priority settings</li>
	<li>Prioritise Automatic Downloads - added system to collect stats on success rates and speeds that bots send files to you. Hush will automatically select the 'best' bot to request files from when doing 
	automatic downloads. User can customize how the priority system works by altering settings in Options.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>v0.3.6 to v0.3.9</h2>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>The changelog data for these versions is lost.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>v0.3.5 - 2018xxxx</h2>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>Instant Search - tried using external sqlite client but makes minimal difference to UI freezes on database write. Up to 1500 announce entries is where UI lag begins. Altered Instant Search settings in Options to make max value 500 entries, 50 step increments for spinbox.</li>
	<li>Instant Search - changed harvester code to reduce CPU usage. Substantial improvements</li>
	<li>Instant Search - added zerofilling of packSize and packGets columns so that sorting works correctly</li>
	<li>Media Library - added code to automatically identify which category a file most likely should be, category is tagged onto the end of particular messages in the FCW</li>
	<li>Media Library - added code to automatically move video files to appropriate media library folder based on category (tested OK)</li>
	<li>Media Library - completed Library Options widget. Access via Media Library button on main window.</li>
	<li>Media Library - scan to find names of movies and TV shows already existing in user's collection</li>
	<li>Media Library - auto scan of media library on KVIrc startup</li>
	<li>Options - Bugfix: fixed import and export of settings to file. These weren't working properly.</li>
	<li>Options - Removed Smart Mode toggle option - if you want to refind items using passive search you should press the Clear Haystack button in Options -&gt; Basic</li>
	<li>Passive Search - Changed passive search code to use Hush SQLite database and timer to improve performance and lower system load.</li>
	<li>Passive Search - "Smart mode" (doesn't repeatedly show the same packs) is always employed for passive searching now and passive searching always obeys search exceptions. Instant searching can ignore search exceptions.</li>
	<li>Passive Search - Conversion of passive searching, automated downloads and automated file move into media library locations (TV and Movies only) code to new "hushDownloadHash" system instead of the old "xdccObs" array system.</li>
	<li>Searches - Searches list is now sorted alphabetically so it's easier to find a search term.</li>
	<li>Searches Import - added feature to import passive searches from an external source.</li>
	<li>Searches Import - added IMDB Advanced Search/List as an external source type</li>
	<li>Searches Import - added IMDB Calendar as an external source type</li>
	<li>Searches Import - import compares sourced titles against those found in the media library to prevent finding and auto-downloading content we already have</li>
	<li>Startup - Bugfix: fixed red error tripped by onDCCTransferSuccess when hush::searches object is not created on KVIrc start up</li>
	<li>Transfer Management - Additional message when transfers finish (fail or success). Added ZNC Push of transfer complete messages</li>
	<li>Transfer Management - Attempts to realize when a bot sends an incorrect pack to you. This is currently a crude implementation which will probably block any transfers that aren't initiated by Hush (that can be a good thing though), so needs more work later. (experimental)</li>
	<li>Transfer Management - Automatic cancel of passive DCC transfers (detected by port 0) option added (experimental))</li>
	<li>Transfer Management - Automatic increment of TV show episode value in Searches list on successful download</li>
	<li>Transfer Management - Automatic removal of non-TV episode searches (movies, music, software, files etc.) from Searches list on successful download</li>
	<li>Transfer Management - Bugfix: adjust conditions for logic flow so auto transfers dont get stuck with queued item waiting</li>
	<li>Transfer Management - Bugfix: added onDCCSession* event handlers to deal with incoming transfer of a file that already exists and is fully downloaded (tested Good)</li>
	<li>Transfer Management - Bugfix: added code to create all hush objects when toolbar icon is clicked to prevent red error on DCC transfer success event after code has been modified and rebuilt</li>
	<li>UI - Added options to toggle new features</li>
	<li>UI - Added incoming DCC directory setting to Media Library interface</li>
	<li>UI - General UI tweaks/changes</li>

<p>
<ul>
	<li>Instant Search - fixed Age values to show in local time</li>

	<li>Bugfix - install process creates hush::main object to prevent red error after upgrade of Hush</li>
	<li>Transfer Management - Handle failed DCC transfers (invoked by Hush only) and decide whether to retry download of file. If user cancels transfer, retries are not done.</li>
	<li>Transfer Management - Queue requests if maximum number of Hush transfers already happening. Automatically request next queued request when file transfer completes.</li>
	<li>Transfer Management - Automatically request file when a passive search is found. Deals with filenames that differ but match the search term and decides what to do looking at file transfer status. (In testing)</li>
	<li>UI - Added new Options tab 'Transfers'. Allows user to configure transfer options.</li>
</ul>
</p>

</ul>
</p>

<h2>v0.3.1 - 20180306</h2>

	<li>Started Media Library - hidden at the moment but the base elements are there. Probably needs a rewrite already to use database instead.</li>
	<li>DCC Event Handlers - Adjusted some code in the DCC event handlers for the Instant Search.</li>
	<li>Added Instant Search Options - tabs now split options into categories.</li>
	<li>UI tweaks - adjusted the size and properties of some widgets to try to make them display a little better by default.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>v0.3.0 - 20170517</h2>

<p>
<ul>
	<li>Debug toggle added - go to Options window and press 4444 to toggle debug mode on and off</li>
	<li>Make main window slightly bigger vertically (50 pixels) - because Hush works on various platforms, you may want to resize the windows to make them look better.</li>
	<li>Make Options window slightly bigger vertically (30 pixels)</li>
	<li>Add season/episode value de/increment buttons on Searches window</li>
	<li>Changed functions that display Hush child widgets (Channels, Searches, Options windows) so that windows' sizes and positions are remembered</li>
