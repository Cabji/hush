		<h2>Hush Searches Import Utility</h2>
		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>This feature of Hush allows you to semi-automatically import media titles from an external source into Hush's passive search list. It is ideal for finding upcoming releases and having them simply added into Hush. To access the Searches Import windows, do the following: Hush Main window, click Searches button, click Import Searches... button</p>
		<p><b>URL</b> - The URL is the external page that Hush will look at and analyze to find media titles.<br/>
		<b>Import Type</b> - The dropdown box will be a selection of external sources that you can import titles from. Currently the only option is IMDB's Lists.<br>
		<b>LAUNCH button</b> - LAUNCHes the import.
		</p>
		<p>To obtain a URL for the import utility (opposite click and select "Copy Link Location"): 
		<ol>
			<li>Go to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/search/title">IMDB's Advanced Search Page</a></li>
			<li>Build a search using the options on that page</li>
			<li>Click the Search button at the bottom</li>
			<li>When the page loads you will see all the results returned. Copy the URL from the URL bar of your browser.</li>
			<li>Paste this URL into Hush's Import utility<li>
		</ol>
		<br/>
		Optionally, you can use some of these premade searches: <br/>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/search/title?title_type=feature&release_date=2018-05-01,2019-05-01&languages=en&moviemeter=,200&view=simple&count=250&sort=moviemeter,asc">Upcoming Popular English Feature Films within the Next Year</a> (from May 2018 to May 2019, current at time of writing)</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/search/title?title_type=feature&release_date=2017-01-01,&genres=comedy&languages=en">Most Popular English Comedy Feature Films since 2017 onward</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/search/title?title_type=feature&groups=top_100&languages=en">IMDB's Top 100 of All Time English Feature Films</a></li>
		</ul>
		Note that the utility will pull the results from the loaded <i>page</i> only, not the entire list of results returned by IMDB's search. If you want results from additional <i>pages</i> load the page and paste that URL into the import utility. 
		Be aware that IMDB's searches can return <i>thousands</i> of results so you should build a search you like first on their website, checking exactly what comes up and then import it. You can also control the number of titles shown per page via the IMDB's advanced search options.
		</p>
		<p>The importer will also pull title names from IMDB's premade Lists. You can find lists by googling for them. Lists cna also be refined with additional conditions to narrow them down to whatever suits your needs. The handiest 
		list I found was for new and recently release bluray or dvd titles, which can be refined down further to suit your taste like the following links show: 
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/list/ls016522954/?st_dt=&mode=detail&page=1&ref_=ttls_ref_rt_vt&sort=list_order,asc">New and Recent DVD/Blu-ray Releases</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/list/ls016522954/?st_dt=&mode=detail&page=1&title_type=movie&num_votes=2000%2C&release_date=2018%2C&ref_=ttls_ref_rt_vt&sort=list_order,asc">New and Recent DVD/Blu-ray Releases, Feature Films only, Released 2018 onward, 2000 User Votes minimum</a></li>
		</ul>
		By refining titles to have at least 2000 user votes you filter out more of the lesser known titles. You could inverse that refinement if you <i>want</i> lesser known titles.
