		<h2>Hush Help::Search Exceptions</h2>
		<p><i>Search Exceptions</i> are search queries that are used to tell Hush what we want <u>don't want</u> to find. They are used to provide a way to filter unwanted content from our search results. For example, 
		if you hate branded korean subtitles, you can make a Search Exception for KORSUB and anything with KORSUB in the filename will be dismissed. Search exceptions are not case sensitive. You might search for 1080p 
		quality items but create a search exception for CAM releases which will make it ignore any filenames containing CAM. Be aware that excepting "CAM" will ignore anything that <i>contains</i> CAM also. 
		You may need to except ".CAM" or ".CAM." (without double quotes) to get the results you want.
		</p>
		
		<p>Search Exceptions can also be used to ignore false positive search matches. Some XDCC announce channels may have lines that announce when a new item has become available. This is usually because they contain the filename 
		that matches a search you are looking for. If lines like this appear in the Found Content Window, you can inspect the offending line and add something from it as a search exception.
		</p>
