        <h3>What is Hush?</h3>
        <p>Hush is a search system for XDCC channels. It aids you by privately finding content you want and makes it easier to request from bots.</p>
        <h3>How does it work?</h3>
        <p>For Hush to work, it needs to be told to <i>watch</i> particular IRC channels. The channels Hush needs to watch are the ones that XDCC bots announce their packs in.</p>
        <p>Once Hush is watching XDCC channels, you need to give it something(s) to look for. This replaces the need to search for things publicly in what is usually called the '-chat' channels. Hush offers two methods of searching: <i>passive</i> and <i>instant</i>.</p>
		<p>Passive searching is good for when you are waiting on something to become available. You can set a search for it and Hush will notify you when it appears in the announce channels. Instant searching is for when you want to find something <u>now</u>. Hush stores a temporary database of the activity in announce channels and an instant search will search the local database and show the results it has.</p>
        <h3>How many channels/networks does Hush work with?</h3>
        <p>Currently Hush should work with any XDCC channels that use the default layouts for the bot pack announcements. It is written to handle multiple network connections in KVIrc, so it amalgamates content from multiple channels into a single piece of software.</p>
        <h3>Can Hush notify me when it finds stuff?</h3>
        <p>Yes. From v0.3.0 onward you can push notifications using the ZNC Push module on a <a href="http:/znc.in/">ZNC server</a> to any of the clients the ZNC Push module supports. This requires a ZNC Server which is not documented here.</p>
        <h3>I need more help.</h3>
