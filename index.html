<h3>20230421 Minor update to Search Imports</h3>
<p>
	IMDB updated their HTML, which means the search import feature broke at some point (it was a while ago I think). I noticed this and have updated the IMDB Calendar option in Search Imports ao it is working again. If you use the feature that adds movie titles to the search list automatically, it fixes this.
</p>
<p>
        I have no packaged the bugfix into a new version. Instead, just download the latest version <a href="https://github.com/Cabji/hush">from GitHub here<a/>.
</p>
<h3>20230228 Website Was Down, Hush is on github</h3>
<p>
	The website was down for a day or two I think. By chance I checked it and had to log into the hosting account to reactivate it.
</p>
<p>
        I have made the Hush source code available on github (you get it when you download it anyway). You can find it here: <a href="https://github.com/Cabji/hush">https://github.com/Cabji/hush</a>
</p>
<h3>20220227 Development Has Stopped, Website Was Down</h3>
<p>
	First, I have stopped working on Hush. It is buggy but does what I basically need it to do for me. If you want to use any or all parts 
        of the code, do as you will.
</p>
<p>
	Second, this website was down for I don't know how long. I didn't know the hosting account freezes the account if you don't 
        log in at least once a year. So I logged in and it's back up. I will have to log in once a year.
</p>

<h3>20200401 v0.4.1 Released</h3>
<p>
	I have released v0.4.1 of Hush after an extended period of testing. The download system is prety good, not perfect though.
	Sometimes there are random errors KVIrc creates for a transfer failure like "Unknown Error" and I have no idea how it occurs 
	or how to handle it, so that sort of thing happening will always pose problems to the automatic system.
</p>
<p>
	The auto movie title acquisition seems to work well, but I think it is slowly collecting movie title searches that will never 
	be found and downloaded. I will look into making some form of timestamp register and then making Hush automatically purge 
	searches that are in the Search list for too long.
</p>

<h3>20200102 Eepsite Lost FML</h3>
<p>
	In early December 2019, a whole pool of VPS providers went down in what is called a "deadpool". Basically, all these VPS 
	providers seem to be have run by one entity or person and they were being sold at unsustainable prices. This was great for me 
	and other customers as the VPS accounts were so cheap to buy but inevitably they weren't going to last (unbeknownst to me and many). 
</p>
<p>
	The provider I was using <i>didn't</i> send any email to warn me that the service was going to shut down in mid December even 
	though many other people recieved warning emails about a week or so prior to the off switch being flicked. So I woke up one 
	morning about mid December and found all the services I was running from my VPS were down, which prompted me to investigate only 
	to learn what had happened.
</p>
<p>
	The Hush eepsite was hosted on the VPS and was subsequently lost in this event. I am in the process of restoring my VPS with a 
	new, <i>whitelisted</i>, provider. I am unsure if I will bother to restore the eepsite, as its source code is lost. I thought I had 
	the old VPS's account backing up but it looks like it wasn't.
</p>
<p>
	For now I am restoring the download page on this website to make Hush available.
</p>
<h3>20191022 V0.4.0 Released</h3>
<p>
	Version 0.4.0 of Hush is released. This version has a fairly stable automatic downloading system (there are still some bugs though). The major improvement is the Transfer Priority system which automatically 
	collects transfer success rate data and then decides which bots to download from. You can choose to give priority to specific channels as well if you like. Anyway, get it into you. It's available on the eepsite.
</p>

<h3>20190519 V0.3.9 Released</h3>
<p>
	Version 0.3.9 has been released. It features updates and improvements to the Download Queue, adds an option for automated movie title acquisition and various other bugfixes. Download is available from the 
	<a href="http://hush.i2p">Hush eepsite</a>.
</p>
<h3>20190217 - v0.3.8 Released Earlier This Month</h3>
<p>v0.3.8 of Hush released earlier this month and development continues toward v0.3.9. Sorry if you find bugs in these releases as I know there always will be. I work hard to try to minimize and rid the code of bugs, but 
it seems like every time I add a new feature it introduces a new set of bugs. Maybe its just the nature of programming software, or maybe I'm just a crap programmer? Either way, sorry but slowly I am fixing it up.</p>
<p>You probably will be wondering where the download link for version after 0.3.6 are? They aren't here on the website. I have moved Hush offcially to the "eepsite" so you need to install 
<a href="https://geti2p.net/en/">i2p router</a> to access the eepsite at <a href="hush.i2p">hush.i2p</a>. i2p is an anonymous layer of internet access and runs like any program in your computer to give you access to the i2p network of eepsites. You might be able 
to access the eepsite using TOR as well, but i'm unsure about that and never used it.</p>
<p>Also I have seen from the web stats that I've had some new visitors from around the world. I hope you like the idea of Hush and that it is useful for you.</p>
<h3>20181105 - i2p eepsite</h3>
<p>I have decided to move the Hush website to the <a href="https://geti2p.net/en/">i2p</a> network.</p>
<p>i2p is an 'anonymous internet' network which offers greater privacy. Given the nature of the Hush addon, I think it is appropriate to move to i2p. If users really want it, they will either put in the effort to access the official 
eepsite to get the software, or they will find the software themselves at other sources online not affiliated with the developer.</p>
<p>This website will remain, but it will probably just contains a list of <a href="hushChecksums.html">checksum values</a> so users can verify if a file they obtain has been altered or not.</p>
<p>The eepsite is already up, at <a href="http://hush.i2p/">hush.i2p</a> or at <a href="http://kxcyhuzgp2wlxz4sczyzgoj7vkoaopl3a5tyb644rtexcjjky43a.b32.i2p/">http://kxcyhuzgp2wlxz4sczyzgoj7vkoaopl3a5tyb644rtexcjjky43a.b32.i2p/</a>.</p>
If you already have i2p router running you can <a href="http://hush.i2p/?i2paddresshelper=8MJAwsEAzS3ZjeUbNgQTa4ie~8WehiDIB-eUhyOWpqzFkbnqVtAh2W1EgZoOOVvGBg50kPcXKZMm5yNLzq6fPnQ2F9IDn76SnIR2UQ6MAgnlAI99XZh3qyEsXeP5xhykJYbh3tnZMTxOx-plrU60OnAL9ENK9nnjcc5HghgSdAk4JNdlqhkrAf5eILSfS5S5q7FxlohzSctp0TC2eYudRNDqk7aS8z75iTVtm4KgIXy4qNN0~~Ad6LtigqyxIZ~OX7990liQuykwtQKBWa3EWES4tTepkdWmuDM8Up-6VAkB7bqT8RZkneaqoM3HesN2bubO9BJEF9t2ioIM8P4oAaWqg86971v9DnIVh17vjWnHr144bw0PFkT-gysmxMq01LTxuhTsUm99bA4N7gceWwqezML2KO74SgZR5PuTulAZhMmlQzsmKd3AXcEbHqYhT16l3JziAClTCiqBQqGtn9t48nABH0Y5wmgN1CBsSVQMOZlPyRrW9B5c3Rtgb-43BQAEAAcAAA==">add it to your addressbook</a>.</p>
<h3>20181027 - Bug Update</h3>
<p>Just a notice to say that I've been testing the auto download system more and with v0.3.6 you shouldn't set the number of auto downloads above 1 because the auto download system will download clone files which leads to bad 
data and then will automatically disable event handlers etc. In other words - it's not working correctly if you set it over 1 auto download at a time.
</p>
<p>
This bug is the first thing I will be working on fixing, the bold item in the <a href="hushChangelog.html">Changelog</a> is always my current coding target.
</p>
<h3>20181017 - v0.3.6 Released and Feedback Channel</h3>
<p>The 0.3.5 automatic downloading system was tested a fair bit before this release and it seems to work pretty good. I have also added support to update your Kodi clients using Hush. It uses HTTP to send the update notice to 
Kodi devices on your network. You have to configure the username/password, IP and port numbers in Hush options for it to work, and if you want it to be automatic make sure you tick the option under the Transfers tab as well. 
This release also hasn't been optimized for use on Linux so Linux users will have to keep waiting until I put in the timer for that. The Linux specific code really only affects the auto move to library locations option, but 
the script is completely untested on Linux so I really don't even know if it works as expected.</p>
<p>The script is now at a point where it needs some more testing from users. If you want to give feedback about the script, you can find me in #hush on i2p IRC.
<h3>20181003 - v0.3.5 Released!</h3>
<p>It is finally here.</p>
<p>Now some caveats: 
<ul>
<li>This version has been tested on Windows OS only. It should mostly work on Linux though.</li>
<li>It will build a database file on your computer. The size of this file varies based on your settings but I watch 6 channels and retain 90 minutes of pack announcements and this makes a file that is almost 14Mb</li>
<li>Explore all the settings and features first. Configure first then enable the database and the passive searching toggles. I didn't test it from a clean install so I don't know if there are bugs in those areas.</li>
<li>If you want to automatically move items into your collection <i>this will only work on Windows OS</i>. It hasn't been written for Linux yet.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Other than that, hopefully it works for you.</p>
<h3>20180925 - Development Update</h3>
<p>Have been putting my back into it lately when I can. Did the code rewrite for all of the DCC event handling to make it use the new hushDownloadHash system I made from the SQL driven passive search code. Right now I am letting
it run and checking for bugs, which there definitely will be some of but it seems to work as expected 80% of the time so far. The 0.3.5 release will include: 
<ul>
<li>Total re-write of the passive search system - CPU usage stays at <1% except for when the passive search timer triggers. It will spike to ~15% for a few seconds while that runs but it depends on how much stuff you are passively searching for. (I have about 190 items in searches)</li>
<li>Automated downloading option - Hush will build a "downloadHash" (it's like a download queue but there's no GUI to see it) when it fires its passive search timer. If auto downloading is enabled, it will then begin traversing through that queue.</li>
<li>Retry failed downloads - If a download fails short of completion, it will retry up to a specified number of times before advancing to the next item in the queue.</li>
<li>Automated moving files into your media collection - (v0.3.5 - TV Shows and Movies only and only for Windows OS) If you configure where you store your media on your local hard disk, once a file transfer completes Hush will decide where to put it in your media library based on the file's category. Unknown types just stay in the download directory.</li>
<li>Attempts to realize when a bot is sending you an incorrect pack. This usually occurs when a bot's pack number changes for the file you want. The current code to monitor this is pretty crude and I think it will block any transfer not initiated by Hush (which can be a good thing) so use it at your own peril. There is an option to switch it on and off.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>For now, once I've done enough testing and think these features are close to ''stable'' I will release 0.3.5. After that I need to write the Linux specific code for auto move to library, and then aim for things like automated 
searches acquisition etc. and all other little features that just aren't such a priority compared to what I've been doing now.</p>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>Hush is an addon for <a href="http://www.kvirc.net/">KVIrc</a> and requires at least v4.9.2 or higher from v0.2.6 onwards. For Windows binaries of KVIrc v4.9.x please visit <a href="https://github.com/kvirc/KVIrc/wiki/Downloading-KVIrcs-nightly-source-or-binaries#windows-appveyor-artifacts-instructions">Downloading KVIrc Nightly Binaries for Windows</a> and follow the instructions listed there.</p>
<p>Hush aims to create a search system for XDCC channels along with automation for a number of aspects related to your media content. It removes the need to: publicly search for content, use subscription systems that reside 
on other computers and provides a degree of automation to continue content acquisition. It supports watching multiple IRC networks and channels. It should work with any XDCC channel that uses the default bot announcement 
message layout.</p>
<p>See also the <a href="hushAbout.html">About</a> file. (Probably not up to date)

<h2>Development</h2>
<p>Hush is a hobby project being developed by one person mostly for personal enjoyment, so updates are sparodic - as time and life permits - but it is classed as "under development" by the author.</p>
<p>It is written in KVS, KVIrc's internal scripting language.</p>

<h2>Download</h2>
<p>
	You can download any/all version of Hush from here.
</p>

<h4>IMPORTANT FOR USERS UPGRADING TO v0.4.0</h4>
<p>
	v0.4.0 introduces the Transfer Priority system. This system requires a new table in the Hush database.
	Hush will create the table it needs if you reset the Hush database in the Options.
	To do this, click: Hush -> Options -> Searching -> Reset Entire Database
</p>
<p>
	Note: you will lose all the current pack announce data and the 'haystack' data when you do this. 
	Just wait a while and Hush will rebuild all the content in the database as bots announce in the channels.
	The haystack data is built by Hush as it finds passive searched items.
</p>

<h4>Important Message for v0.2.6 or lower Users <i>Upgrading</i> Hush</h4>
<p>
	If upgrading, make sure you export your hush settings prior to installing the new version! The upgrade routine will remove your settings file and you will have to enter all your settings again. To export your settings go to Hush -&gt; Options -&gt; Export Settings and save to a file. Import from this file after upgrading.
</p>
<p>
	From v0.2.7 onwards there is a dialog asking if you want to preserve your existing config file when uninstalling or upgrading the script.
